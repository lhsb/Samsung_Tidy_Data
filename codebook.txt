The detailed codebook is packed with the data. Please read README.md for detail information.

I had to make syntactically valid names, so there are small changes in the variable names.

Description of changes:
-----------------------
All invalid characters are translated to ".". A missing value is translated to "NA". 
Names which match R keywords have a dot appended to them.
Duplicated values are altered by make.unique.
